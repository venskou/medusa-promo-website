                  We have realized from the beginning that our unique payment facility coupled with the brokerage allows
                  us to apply the concept of simple and safe high value payments globally to any asset class.
                  To this end we have created a process whereby we are able to tokenize any asset to make it eligible for
                  transacting through our platform to the benefit and convenience of our clients.

                  intellectual property, a house, a business, or a painting can be tokenised according to the following steps.

                  Medusa Brokerage recognizes that whilst technology innovation is important, the success of any business
                  in the end still relies heavily on its ability to connect its services to potential customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to achieve this objective Medusa Brokerage has decided to create a unique solution that ensures
                  our services are delivered to potential customers efficiently. Our service delivery is carried out by a group
                  of individuals called Agents, who are accredited members of our brokerage tasked with introducing
                  Medusa to prospective clients and benefit long term from commissions arising from client trading.

                  The OTC market for the trading of cryptocurrencies and various other asset classes are crowded with
                  agents who represent buyers and sellers that are looking for counterparties in order to trade. The need
                  to have a reliable and clear platform through which these agents can transact and manage their client
                  relationships is critical.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Agents pay a monthly fee of $88 or a yearly lump sum of $888 to maintain their accreditation on the platform. The fee is payable in Medusa tokens
                  purchased from the open market and deliverable to Medusa Brokerage.
