              <p>
                Medusa Brokerage is an invite only trading platform where high value tokenized asset transactions are
                facilitated in an OTC trading environment. Basic membership for clients is free of charge and involves the
                standard sign up process crypto users have become accustomed to when joining exchanges.
              </p>
              <p>
                After passing a strong KYC/AML process the client can begin trading similarly to traditional platforms by
                inputting orders for transactions of listed crypto tokens or ICOs.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the client can also speak directly to Medusa Brokers who are available to help originate, find
                counterparties to and manage OTC orders for the buying and selling of any tokenized asset.

                We have realized from the beginning that our unique payment facility coupled with the brokerage allows
                us to apply the concept of simple and safe high value payments globally to any asset class.
              </p>
              <p>
                To this end we have created a process whereby we are able to tokenize any asset to make it eligible for
                transacting through our platform to the benefit and convenience of our clients.

                intellectual property, a house, a business, or a painting can be tokenised according to the following steps.

                    <li>
                      <strong class="color-blue">c.</strong> The trust document determines the rules that govern how the trust works and the Medusa
                      trustee is appointed, whose function is to ensure that the rights of the beneficial owners of

                        Simultaneously to the establishment of the trust, the virtual asset is divided by
                        the desired amount of tokens selected by the seller. The requisite number of asset
                        tokens are created and now have a unit value. The trust document declares that
                        whoever holds those tokens is deemed by the trust to be the beneficial owner of the
                        asset.

                    <li>
                      <strong class="color-blue">a.</strong> For example, the seller’s house could be denominated in 100 HOUSE tokens, 10,000
                      HOUSE tokens or just 10 HOUSE tokens, depending on what the seller has defined and
                      hence appears in the trust document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong class="color-blue">b.</strong> The tokens represent beneficial ownership of the assets held by the trust. Each token can
                      be given specific voting rights or any other rights which the trust document specifies.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After this process has occurred, the seller’s house is now fully owned by the trust but the beneficial
                owners, in other words the person or people who are to receive all benefits of the trust’s asset, will be the
                holders of the tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially the holder of all the tokens which represent the asset, and therefore the full beneficial ownership
                of the house, was the seller. The seller could still enjoy the asset, use it according to whatever rules were
                originally put in place in the trust at its inception, but the seller no longer legally owns the asset.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is clear to see that once this process is completed the beneficial ownership of the house can easily be
                traded from person to person for any other asset at any time, with the added benefit of visibility which a
                public blockchain provides given that there is an absolute and perfectly clear audit chain and clarity on
                the trustees.
              </p>
              <p>
                HOUSE tokens can be exchanged for another property, fiat, crypto or any other tokenized asset listed for
                exchange on the platform through the intermediation of Medusa tokens.

              <p>
                Investors purchasing all, or any fraction of, the token supply will become owners of a corresponding
                percentage of the asset those tokens represent. In the event the asset appreciate or produce returns the
                investors will benefit. Provided the terms of the trust allow, token holders may also be vested with voting
                rights to participate in the governance of the asset.

                There is no limit to the flexibility of this solution and we have come to realize this during our testing phase

                yachts, art, real estate and other exotic assets or to send remittances internationally at fraction of the cost

                Agents pay a monthly fee of $88 or a yearly lump sum of $888 to maintain their accreditation on the
                platform. The fee is payable in Medusa tokens purchased from the open market and deliverable to
                Medusa Brokerage.

                It is the objective of every agent to find clients and onboard them to the platform so that they can be
                credited for sourcing a new transacting member. Introductions are not always direct and often happen
                through multiple individuals. This typically leads to insurmountable difficulties in the OTC market where
                lack of standardization, professionalism and contractual guarantees prevent deals from progressing to the
                frustration of all participants.
