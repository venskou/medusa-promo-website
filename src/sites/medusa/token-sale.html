            <strong>Medusa Agent Program</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Medusa Agents can now turn their natural ability to network and build contacts in the real world into a
            legitimate profession that will earn them considerable income if they are successful in accomplishing
            their main two main tasks: recruiting clients and other agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having analysed this space we understand how potential deals emerge. Individuals come across
            interested parties who are looking for a counterparty to a particular deal. A good agent then begins the
            process of sourcing leads through their existing network. It is this exact network of key individuals which
            we wish to help agents monetize in a structured and standardized way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently the market is replete with individuals who are vying for contacts and deals in the extremely
            competitive OTC markets. In numerous asset classes buyers and sellers are willing to complete deals,
            except the uncertainty in the intermediary space prevents genuine parties from transacting.
            Medusa is reshaping this space by guaranteeing certainty with respect to commissions and legitimacy
            with the Medusa brand and concept. By providing the appropriate motivations and guarantees, the OTC
            market will be enriched with a new approach to doing business.
          </p>
          <p>
            The agent network is an extremely valuable asset to Medusa and its clients, as it is a self-motivated team
            of professionals dedicated to the growth of the Medusa ecosystem. In recognition of the contribution
            agents make to the long term success of the platform we have enabled them to profit from their work in
            a way not previously seen in the market.

              Agent Requirements
            </strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            To become eligible for commissions an agent must fulfill the basic requirements imposed by Medusa
            Brokerage. The requirements are comprised of the following main points
          </p>
          <p>
            Agents incur a monthly membership fee of $88 which can be paid in a lump sum of $888 for the year for
            a total savings of 16%.
          </p>
          <p>
            In exchange, they receive, amongst other benefits, access to their personal portfolio management system
            through which they can track all clients and agents as well as commissions earned.

            <strong>The Two Main Activities</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Agents have two potential portfolio building activities they can undertake: recruiting clients and other
            agents. Let us look at both of these options in detail.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong class="color-blue">1.</strong> Agent recruitment is the act of introducing another active agent to Medusa Brokerage for the
              purposes of helping that individual become accredited and with their help increase the potential
              reach of the collective network to additional clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="color-blue">2.</strong> Client recruitment is the act of bringing a client from the preferred portfolio of target clientele to
              Medusa Brokerage for the purpose of helping the client create an account and use the unique
              services offered to them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="typo__dots">
            <span></span>
          </div>
          <h4>
            <strong>Building a Portfolio</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            By pursuing their two main objectives, a successful agent will invariable accumulate an expanding
            portfolio of agents and associated clients in their network. This expansion is a natural consequence as
            Medusa Brokerage is an invite only platform. All subsequent clients that arrive to the platform within the
            network of an agent have the potential to generate financial benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The compensation scheme is founded on the concept of Degrees of Separation (DoS). This simply refers to
            the number of people by which a person within your network is separated from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you are the originating point, an Agent who is DoS 2 relative to you is a person who has been
            introduced to the platform by an agent you referred personally. DoS 7 would be an individual who is the
            seventh person in a line of subsequent agent referrals from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This structure clearly creates a multi tired system that orders agents around you as your network expands.
            Medusa Brokerage tracks this network through eight degrees of separation and displays it to all agents to
            show the current size and reach of their portfolio.
          </p>
          <div class="typo__quote">
            <span>
              Medusa understands that its not
              always “What you know” but “Who
              you know” that matters.
            </span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Now that the concept of the network of agents has been clearly defined, it is easy to visualize this
            structure.
          </p>
          <div class="typo__img">
            <img src="../../assets/img/svg/sale-scheme.svg" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Each node on this specific network represents an agent. As described previously, besides recruiting other
            agents the chief task, naturally, is to recruit clients. Therefore, any and all clients that are associated with
            an agent within your network fall within the same DoS as their respective agent. For example if an agent
            on DoS 3 has three clients then those three clients are also on DoS 3 in relation to you.
          </p>
          <div class="typo__dots">
            <span></span>
          </div>
          <h4>
            <strong>Eligibility of Comissions</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            There is a lot of competition in the OTC market between agents to claim clients and commissions. It is
            very important to apply a clear set of rules to help determine which agent is eligible for commissions on a
            transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition there is a significant amount of payment insecurity for agents as traditionally they were not
            covered contractually. This risk prevents many OTC agents from connecting leads for fear of being cut out
            of the deal. Medusa Brokerage eliminates this fear and empowers agents to push forward and build a
            profitable client portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following are the rules with respect to determining eligibility for commissions:

            This means that the agents within the brokerage operate like bridges between the clients, who are
            nodes in a network. The objective of the agents is to create as many interlocking connections as possible.
            Clients have the authority to execute trades through their account and a connection between nodes is a
            synonym for a completed transaction.

            <strong>Types of Agencies</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Two types of agencies exist within the Medusa platform. Any agent can be either a Connected Agent or
            Connecting Agent for any given transaction, depending on their particular role in the given deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each type of agency has their separate commission payout which is described in greater detail herein.

            <strong>Earnings from your Network</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            All commissions are paid in Medusa tokens to agents directly to their Medusa Brokerage wallet upon
            settlement of any transaction that warranted a monetary reward to the appropriate individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medusa Bokerage pays out 50% of its transaction revenues in commissions after card processing expenses
            have been deducted. This means that in the event of a transaction that has $6,000 margin after card fees
            on the buy side, $3,000 is Available for Distribution (AfD) for all buy side agents. The same commission
            structure applies to the sell side as shown below in this example.
          </p>
          <p>
            AfD commissions are split between Connected and Connecting agents as per the table below showing
            the percentages paid to each agent type.
          </p>
          <div class="typo__img">
            <img src="../../assets/img/svg/sale-table-1.svg" style="max-width: 500px" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Out of the total AfD available to the buy side agents, $1,000 is paid to the Connected Agent and $1,000 to
            the Connecting Agent if applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event that there are multiple intermediary Connecting Agents they split the available commission
            equally.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remaining 33% of AfD or $1,000 is paid out to the Agent Network. In the event there is no Connecting
            Agent(s), the available 33% is added to the Agent Network’s 33% for a total of 66% to be paid out to the
            network.

            <strong>Bonus Pool</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Medusa Brokerage has made provisions for a discretionary bonus pool for top agents. From the available
            commission per category shown in the table, 8 x 8% or 64% is paid out and 36% is reserved.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to motivate and reward the most ambitious and hardworking agents, Medusa Brokerage has set
            aside a portion of each commission revenue stream to award as warranted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonuses will be distributed according to the judgment and approval of management.

            <strong>Membership Fees</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Medusa Brokerage charges a monthly membership fee of $88 to agents which can also be paid in a yearly
            lump sum of $888.
          </p>
          <p>
            Membership fees are used to finance the accreditation process of agents as well as the maintenance and
            further development of the agent’s client portfolio management platform and support network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time an agent in your network successfully maintains their accredited status you become eligible
            for a success fee paid by Medusa Brokerage to you in Medusa tokens as per the table below.
