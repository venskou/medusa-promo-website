                      to purchase or sell ultra-high volumes of Medusa tokens with their existing bank card, which can then be exchanged for any tokenized asset.
                      This allows us to achieve our goal of providing our clients with the service they are looking for at the most competitive prices.

                          to open an account with the brokerage. This includes the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money
                          Laundering (AML) processes crypto users have become accustomed to when opening accounts on
                          exchanges.

                          has a virtually limitless selection of tradable assets. This extends to ICOs who wish to offer users the ability
                          to invest in their projects with large volumes of 恁at easily through MPS as well as buyers and sellers or
                          high value assets through the process of tokenization.

                          perspective to specialize in facilitating transactions for tokenized assets. We believe in the continued
                          progression of blockchain technology and the advent of converting assets to allow their buying and
                          selling through tokens

                          Whilst transaction limits are reasonable for nascent markets and high risk assets,
                          they are not sophisticated enough tools to apply judiciously to all transactions and processes. Through
                          our unique payment facility we have succeeded in divorcing the main aspects of risk that have prevented
                          恁nancial institutions from allowing market participants from conducting larger trades and thus are able
                          to offer higher card purchase limits through MPS.

                          understand that investors who wish to enter the market are already facing price risk and the additional
                          exposure to fraud or transaction issues may amount to a collective risk pro恁le that is in excess of what
                          they are willing to take on. In order to allow members to only focus on investment decisions we have
                          stripped out these risk factors for transaction conducted through MPS.

                        <h5><strong>Naked Period</strong> </h5>
                        <p>
                          We have coined this term to describe the position an investor occupies when undergoing
                          a tradition token purchase in the market. In the event a bank transfer is used to attempt to purchase
                          a desired crypto currency the buyer has to send monies to an exchange. At this point the investor has
                          sent 䢴at which is now in transit to the exchange. The buyer therefore does not have possession of the 䢴at
                          money nor the crypto currency. Therefore we call this period, where the buyer does not have ownership
                          of either asset type, the Naked Period. With MPS the purchase of Medusa tokens is instantaneous and the
                          Naked Period in effect does not exist.

                        <h5><strong>Intermediary Risk</strong> </h5>
                        <p>
                          Unbeknownst to many market participants, money transfers often happen through
                          several intermediary banks to arrive at their destinations. The journey of a funds transfer can be a lot more
                          complicated then what people are led to believe. The interception or stoppage of a wire can occur at any
                          point within the chain of institutions involved in the execution of the order. Because the buyer purchases
                          Medusa tokens through our MPS facility upon card authorization immediately, and those Medusa tokens
                          are accepted by all sellers on the Medusa platform for their assets, Medusa has managed to bypass all
                          intermediaries, hence the risk of a transaction being stopped, delayed or intercepted for any reason are
                          eliminated.

                          Providing liquidity is not a one way street. Whilst MPS can be used for investors to buy
                          crypto currencies ICOs or tokenized asset at high volumes for 䢴at currencies, the need to unwind crypto
                          positions for 䢴at also exists. ICOs that have successfully raised crypto to fund their project will have a need
                          to convert those coins into 䢴at to fund operations. Medusa provides the option to unwind positions and
                          have 䢴at currency pushed onto the nominated card of the seller.

                          simplest manner possible and have the fewest number of limitations and restriction imposed on them.
                          Our belief is that the elimination of limits and risks will result in the increasing of investment in and wider

                      Medusa Brokerage understands the risks investors are facing in the markets. Not only price risk of the
                      acquired asset, but the process of sending the funds to their destination as well as the performance of the
                      counterparty upon the completion of the transfer all pose substantial risks.

                    <p>
                      Undoubtedly the accumulated risks from the potential break points of such investments have posed too
                      large of an obstacle to surmount for many individuals sitting on the side-lines of the crypto market. We
                      at Medusa have created a platform where members need only focus on investment decisions as we have
                      stripped out these risk factors for transaction conducted through MPS.

                      Medusa Brokerage members as standard. There is no premium charged for insurance and there are no
                      exceptions with respect to asset type.

                    <p>
                      Any transactions that exceed the $2.5m threshold will also benefit from insurance. However these
                      transactions will be requested from our insurers prior to the commencement of the trade and will be
                      executed through an accredited Medusa Broker.
