              <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Medusa intends to become an important liquidity gateway for the crypto market by making it easier for
                large volumes of money to enter and leave the crypto space. Given our team’s experience in financial
                services, blockchain technology, and new international regulations, we have identified an opportunity at
                the intersection of these sectors which allows us to offer something truly unique to the industry.
              </p>
              <div class="typo__img">
                <img src="../../assets/img/content/intro.png" />
              </div>
              <p>
                At the overlapping of these three magisteria you will find Medusa. While experts abound in these fields,
                it is very rare to find a company which has a deep understanding of all three domains and can translate
                that understanding into a business opportunity
              </p>
              <p>
                At Medusa we have identified the opportunity of creating a highly specialized payment processing service
                which allows clients of Medusa Brokerage to purchase or sell ultra-high volumes of Medusa tokens with
                their existing bank card, which can then be exchanged for any tokenized asset.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typically this solution is not viable. Card transactions carry too much risk for acquirers to process the
                payments due to the potential of chargeback on the purchase. Anyone who has ever ventured into
                the crypto space has encountered a wall that is as strange and incomprehensible to them as their first
                reading of what Bitcoin is.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is an unusual encounter indeed, when someone who grew up in the culture of instant gratification
                is confronted with the concept of purchasing limits. A customer wants to buy and they can’t. This is
                anathema to our understanding of normal commercial practices. As seasoned participants in the crypto
                world, we at Medusa have ourselves often encountered frustrating limits and barriers to purchasing coins
                or participating in ICOs, only to see opportunities pass us by. It is a tough choice to make when you are
                hod’ling one coin and have to decide whether to use that to invest in an ICO.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is our view that we should not have to make such decisions. Opportunities arise quickly and unless one
                is a professional crypto analyst it is not possible to be prepared ahead of time for every ICO, and we would
                submit that it is tough, even for professionals, to keep up with the proliferation of new tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                ICOs are not the only instances where we felt like we were restricted in our ability to take advantage of an
                opening. Seeing a lot of long red candles on the charts instinctively signals a potential buying opportunity.
                Bank transfers can take days and sometimes are rejected or are stopped by intermediary institutions.
                Online purchases between individuals are possible but the prices tend to be too elevated, insufficient in
                size, or unavailable depending on geography. Of course, there is also risk. Multiple channels exist but none
                satisfied our criteria of:
              </p>
              <div class="typo__highlited">
                <span>
                  Simple, high-volume transactions, safely.
                </span>
              </div>
              <p>
                Anyone who can solve these three deceptively simple issues will have created a goose that lays the
                golden egg in the crypto world.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is apparent that the crypto space would experience a large influx of additional capital in the event the
                complexity of entry into the space was eliminated to such an extent that anyone with a bank card could
                purchase or cash out large volumes of tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not new. However, when coupled with the ability to buy millions of dollars’ worth of tokens from
                an ICO instantly and have peace of mind by knowing that your purchase is fully insured, it is completely
                unheard of.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine you are sitting in front of your screen and see that the Bitcoin price just dropped considerably.
                You had a view, and now the price has actually dropped to where you wanted to get in, but it’s too soon.
                You haven’t sent the money to your exchange account. No problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have set up a Medusa Brokerage account you can use your card and buy to your heart’s content. You
                won’t ever miss out again, whether you wish to buy established coins or ICO tokens. You are fully insured
                and protected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conversely, individuals who have a large crypto position can exit their trade through Medusa by
                unwinding their position. The Medusa platform will facilitate the sale of their crypto and push the fiat of
                their choice onto their registered bank card.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are confident a large proportion of individuals and companies trading, or desiring to trade in high
                values won’t be transacting tokens anywhere else again.

                The Medusa Payment Service is a versatile offering that allows our platform to build bridges between real
                world industries and the digital crypto ecosystem. Owing to our unique payment facility we are able to draw
                material distinctions between our processes and comparable offerings currently in the marketplace.

              <p>
                The following chart draws a comparison between Medusa and the standard providers operating in this space

              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Account Opening:</strong> Medusa members all have to undergo the customary background checks required
                to open an account with the brokerage. This includes the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money
                Laundering (AML) processes crypto users have become accustomed to when opening accounts on
                exchanges.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Asset Selection:</strong> Besides crypto currencies, Medusa Brokerage has focused on providing a platform that
                has a virtually limitless selection of tradable assets. This extends to ICOs who wish to offer users the ability
                to invest in their projects with large volumes of fiat easily through MPS as well as buyers and sellers or
                high value assets through the process of tokenization.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Payment Selection:</strong> Usual bank transfers such as SWIFT and SEPA are available to Medusa Brokerage
                members; however our unique payment gateway, MPS, has been developed with a forward looking
                perspective to specialize in facilitating transactions for tokenized assets. We believe in the continued
                progression of blockchain technology and the advent of converting assets to allow their buying and
                selling through tokens.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Transaction Limits:</strong> Whilst transaction limits are reasonable for nascent markets and high risk assets,
                they are not sophisticated enough tools to apply judiciously to all transactions and processes. Through
                our unique payment facility we have succeeded in divorcing the main aspects of risk that have prevented
                financial institutions from allowing market participants from conducting larger trades and thus are able
                to offer higher card purchase limits through MPS.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Insurance:</strong> Mitigating risk in not only important for institutions but also customers. We at Medusa
                understand that investors who wish to enter the market are already facing price risk and the additional
                exposure to fraud or transaction issues may amount to a collective risk profile that is in excess of what
                they are willing to take on. In order to allow members to only focus on investment decisions we have
                stripped out these risk factors for transaction conducted through MPS.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Naked Period:</strong> We have coined this term to describe the position an investor occupies when undergoing
                a tradition token purchase in the market. In the event a bank transfer is used to attempt to purchase
                a desired crypto currency the buyer has to send monies to an exchange. At this point the investor has
                sent fiat which is now in transit to the exchange. The buyer therefore does not have possession of the fiat
                money nor the crypto currency. Therefore we call this period, where the buyer does not have ownership
                of either asset type, the Naked Period. With MPS the purchase of Medusa tokens is instantaneous and the
                Naked Period in effect does not exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Intermediary Risk:</strong> Unbeknownst to many market participants, money transfers often happen through
                several intermediary banks to arrive at their destinations. The journey of a funds transfer can be a lot more
                complicated then what people are led to believe. The interception or stoppage of a wire can occur at any
                point within the chain of institutions involved in the execution of the order. Because the buyer purchases
                Medusa tokens through our MPS facility upon card authorization immediately, and those Medusa tokens
                are accepted by all sellers on the Medusa platform for their assets, Medusa has managed to bypass all
                intermediaries, hence the risk of a transaction being stopped, delayed or intercepted for any reason are
                eliminated.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Exit Option:</strong> Providing liquidity is not a one way street. Whilst MPS can be used for investors to buy
                crypto currencies ICOs or tokenized asset at high volumes for fiat currencies, the need to unwind crypto
                positions for fiat also exists. ICOs that have successfully raised crypto to fund their project will have a need
                to convert those coins into fiat to fund operations. Medusa provides the option to unwind positions and
                have fiat currency pushed onto the nominated card of the seller.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong class="color-blue">Exit Limit:</strong> The same principals of limits apply for the exiting of positions as for the purchases of all assets
                on the Medusa platform. Medusa aims to start with a $2.5m purchase and sell limit and increase this
                rapidly as we scale. As a service provider our aim is to allow our members to conduct their trading in the
                simplest manner possible and have the fewest number of limitations and restriction imposed on them.
                Our belief is that the elimination of limits and risks will result in the increasing of investment in and wider
                adoption of crypto currencies.

              <h4><strong>Insurance</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Medusa Brokerage understands the risks investors are facing in the markets. Not only price risk of the
                acquired asset, but the process of sending the funds to their destination as well as the performance of the
                counterparty upon the completion of the transfer all pose substantial risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Undoubtedly the accumulated risks from the potential break points of such investments have posed too
                large of an obstacle to surmount for many individuals sitting on the side-lines of the crypto market. We
                at Medusa have created a platform where members need only focus on investment decisions as we have
                stripped out these risk factors for transaction conducted through MPS.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each purchase conducted through Medusa Payment Service is automatically insured up to $2.5m for all
                Medusa Brokerage members as standard. There is no premium charged for insurance and there are no
                exceptions with respect to asset type.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any transactions that exceed the $2.5m threshold will also benefit from insurance. However these
                transactions will be requested from our insurers prior to the commencement of the trade and will be
                executed through an accredited Medusa Broker.
              </p>
              <p>
                The full details of the thresholds for tranches and ultra-high transactions will be disclosed at the launch of
                the payment gateway.
